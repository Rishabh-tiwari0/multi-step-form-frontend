Multi-Step Form
Overview
A multi-step form is a user interface design pattern that breaks down a long or complex form into smaller, more manageable sections. Each section typically represents a step in the process, guiding the user through the form one step at a time. This approach improves user experience by reducing cognitive overload and making the form-filling process less intimidating.

Features
Step Navigation: Users can navigate between different steps of the form using intuitive navigation controls such as "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Validation: Real-time validation ensures that users provide correct and complete information for each step before proceeding to the next step.

Progress Indicator: A progress indicator displays the user's current position in the multi-step form, showing how many steps are completed and how many remain.

Data Persistence: User input is saved and retained as the user progresses through the form, allowing them to go back and edit previous steps without losing entered data.

Responsive Design: The multi-step form is designed to be responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
